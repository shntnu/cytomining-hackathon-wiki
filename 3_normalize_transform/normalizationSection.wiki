Normalisation and simple transformation

Morphological profiling typically combines features that are fundamentally different in nature, such as intensity, shape, and texture descriptors. Where other profiling methods such as gene expression analysis exclusively generate counts (RNA-Seq) or fluorescence intensity values (microarrays), such homogeneity cannot be assumed for morphological profiles, As a result, we encounter a considerable heterogeneity in the shape of feature value distributions. 
This critically affects downstream analysis methods that require features to be on comparable scales (e.g. supervised and unsupervised machine learning). Simple mathematical transformations are therefore frequently applied to render feature distributions more comparable, with symmetry and homoscedasticity being two of the most important evaluation parameters.
Logarithmic transformations are especially popular and were found to improve error correction and downstream statistical analyses (Durbin et al. Bioinf,2002, Huber et al. Bioinf,2002). Recent profiling screens have successfully adopted a generalized logarithmic function that avoids problems with non-positive feature values (Laufer et al. NatMeth, 2013, Fischer et al. Elife, 2015). For high feature values, it approximates log(x). Its behavior for small absolute values depends on a shrinkage parameter c. For negative values, it approximates –log(-x) (up to a constant dependent on c).
However, it is unlikely that a single transformation will be suitable for all feature types and applications. The necessity of feature transformations should be carefully evaluated for each project.  We recommend carefully studying the effects of feature transformations using diagnostic measures and plots (such as cumulative distribution curves).

In all profiling screens, diagnostic plots (such as plate plots or replicate scatters)
should be generated and inspected in order to assess for systematic artifacts. If 
spatial biases are present on plates, standard methods used for correction include 
B-score (Brideau et al. J Biomol Screen. 2003) and locfit(Loader, C. 1999, Springer NY).
B-score normalization implements a two-way median polish over row and columns, and 
can only be used when biological effects are not heavily confounded with 
technical biases in a column- or row-wise fashion e.g. when key controls are placed 
over a single column, and not distributed over the plate.
Locfit and related methods such as running averages, fit a smoothing surface to the 
plate using local spatial averaging, and return fitting residuals as spatial-corrected values. 
Both B-score and locfit methods are available in the Bioconductor high-throughput screening 
package cellHTS2 (Boutros et al. 2006, GenomeBiol), and are readily applicable to morphological 
profiling data. 

For experiments that are conducted over a long time period, systematic drift in feature 
values over time should also be assessed and corrected for using smoothing techniques. 
In addition, samples are mostly processed in technically defined batches such as plates 
or a number of plates at the same time. There for plate and batch effects need to be normalised for.
Normalization in morphological profiling typically refers to the scoring of feature values 
relative to controls so that the magnitude of a phenotypic effect can be assessed, 
and feature values can be put on a common scale. Normalization strategies should 
be assessed before the screen when the experiment is being designed, so biologists 
and analysts can agree on the choice and layout of relevant controls. 
The robust z-score is less affected by outliers than the standard z-score, and therefore more often useful in applied settings. 
If the expectation is that few wells on a plate will be phenotypically affected by the experimental treatment or condition, 
the z-score can simply be applied across all wells without the need for additional controls. 
When direct comparison to positive or negative controls is desirable, useful methods include Percent Of Control (POC), 
and Normalized Percent Inhibition (NPI). POC does as the name suggests, and can be performed with respect to a single control group.
NPI subtracts the positive control average and divides by the difference between the positive control and negative control averages. 
Finally, if absolute comparisons across plates must be done, normalizing against a common set of reference controls can be performed. 
In all cases, systematic differences between feature values between batches should also be assessed and corrected for.
Previously Birmingham et al. 
reviewed various considerations of normalisations control de-or independent
and concluded that no single method (e.g. percent of control, z-score, multiple of control) superseds all others.
Rather the choice of method for normalising technical biases strongly depends on the performed assay (Birmingham et al. 2009, NatMeth).
A popular normalization choice on the plate level is the robust z-score (i.e. z-score with median and MAD, Malo et al. 2006, NatBiotech).
